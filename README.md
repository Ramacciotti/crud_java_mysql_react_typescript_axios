# Fullstack CRUD Project: Java, SpringBoot, Mysql, React, Typescript, Axios

🎙️ Hello, how are you? Glad to see you here! This is a fullstack project that involves both backend and frontend. So, if you are in the learning process, this project can help you understand some concepts better. Access different branches to read instructions on how to set each project:

- backend (https://github.com/Ramacciotti/crud_java_mysql_react_typescript_axios/tree/backend) 
- frontend (https://github.com/Ramacciotti/crud_java_mysql_react_typescript_axios/tree/frontend);

## This is awesome! What do I need to start? 💬

🎙️ Good question! For this one, you´ll need installed in your machine:

- IDE (recomendation: Intellij)
- Code Editor (recomendation: Visual Studio Code)
